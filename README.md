# Xamarin-Emoji-and-Gif-Input
This is an unfinished project. Its objective was to be merged with a mobile texting app. This project would be responsible for
showing an Emoji Keyboard and sending the respective Emoji clicked. As well, this project would be responsible for searching
gifs at giphy.com (using their API) and sending the desired gif.

The project is not well organized, and the latest versions of the implementations are not located at the master branch.
